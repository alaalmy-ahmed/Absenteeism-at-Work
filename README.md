# Absenteeism-at-Work

## This Project is about Analyzing the Absenteeism at Work By using the Following Statistical Techniques:
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Analysis

#### After getting Important Plots from the data I use Both those Techniques to approve or deny what the plot tells us.
- Conditional Probabilities & Bayes' Theorem
- Hypothesis Testing

#### After Approving the Insights, The Explanatory Data Analysis uses the `Power BI` tool. Using Simple Visualization Plots like:
- Bar Charts
- Line Charts
- Pie Charts

#### Machine Learning 
1- Data Preprocessing
  - Identifying Leaky Data

  - Dropping High Cardinality Features and Using OneHotEncoder to encode the categorical features

  - Scaling Floating Features so it helps the model overcome Overfitting

  - Variance Inflation Factor to detect Multicollinearity between the feature

2- Model Creation
  - Using PCA (Principle Component Analysis) for Dimensionality Reduction

  - Models Comparison (SVR had the highest neg_mean_absolute_error
  "Cross-Validation" score

  - Using GridSearch For HyperTuning

  - Saving the model
